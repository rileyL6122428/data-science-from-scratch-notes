* Nearest Neighbors Classification

    - Find k nearest neighbors base on some notion of distance between data points,
        then let those neighbors vote on the output

* Curse of Dimensionality

    - High dimensional spaces are vase, distance between two random points in high dimensional space is more likely to be great

* Recommendation on using Nearest Neighbors Classification in High dimension space

    - should probably do some dimension reduction first
