Rationale for moving against the gradient is clear, step size is not.
"Choosing step size is more of an art than a science"

* When can stochastic gradient descent be applied?
    - when error function for data set is additive, i.e. the error on the set is
      the sum of the error on each individual data point

     YOU UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU ACTUALLY USE IT -->
