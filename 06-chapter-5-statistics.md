Quantile is a generalization of the median
says at which value x percent of data lies below
median is 50 percent quantile

dispersion refers to how spread out our data is

for samples for large data sets, divide by x - 1 instead x

standard deviation is adversley affected by outliers
use interquartile range instead

* Simpson's Paradox

    - the idea that correlations can be blatantly misleading when you
        don't account for confounding factors. You should only utilize
        correlations for data sets where "all other variables are equal"
        is a fair assumption.

* Other correlation caveats

    - correlation will only detect linear releationships.
        parabola behavior or abs values will have a correlation of 0
    
    - correlation doesn't tell you rate of correlations, just that it does

    - correlation is not necessarily causation. Causation can be made plausible
        through controlled experiments.
