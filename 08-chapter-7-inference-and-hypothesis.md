Chapter 7 
    In classical hypothesis testing, we have null hypothesis H_0 and alternative
    hypothesis H_1 that we compare against
    Use stats to try to reject H_0

    Need to decide how willing we are to make a "Type 1 Error, or false positive". In which we Reject H_0 even if it is true. Typically willingness
    is set to 5% or 1%

    "Type 2 Error" we fail to reject H_0 even though its false.

    "Power of a test" is the probability of not committing a Type 2 Error
    Basically, you have to have overwhelming evidence to reject null hypotheises, which is why it is referred to as power


    * Continunity Correction

        - used when you use a continous prob distribution to approximate
          a discrete prob distribution.
    
    * What should you do before using p-tests for hypothesis testing?

        - make sure data is  normally distributed
    
    * Confidence Intervals

        - take mean and standard deviation through observation
            then use doublesided normal bounds containing .95 of
            prob and assert that true prob lies in that value.
